# 16. Best Practices

This tutorial covers essential Kafka best practices. Follow these tips for reliable, scalable, and secure Kafka usage.

---

## Quick Checklist

- Use the latest stable Kafka version.
- Monitor cluster health and performance.
- Secure your cluster with authentication and authorization.
- Design topics and partitions for scalability.
- Tune producer and consumer configurations.
- Handle errors and retries gracefully.

---

## Producer Best Practices

- **Idempotence:** Enable idempotent producers to avoid duplicate messages.
- **Batching:** Use batching to improve throughput.
- **Compression:** Enable message compression to save bandwidth.
- **Retries:** Configure retries and backoff for transient errors.
- **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for requests.

---

## Consumer Best Practices

- **Consumer Groups:** Use consumer groups for parallel processing.
- **Manual Offset Commit:** Commit offsets after processing messages to avoid data loss.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and retries.
- **Backpressure:** Control consumption rate to avoid overwhelming downstream systems.

---

## Topic & Partition Design

- **Naming:** Use clear, descriptive topic names.
- **Partitions:** Choose partition count based on expected throughput and parallelism.
- **Retention:** Set retention policies based on business needs.
- **Cleanup:** Use compaction for topics storing latest state.

---

## Config Patterns & Delivery Semantics

- **Acks:** Set `acks=all` for strong durability.
- **Replication:** Use sufficient replication factor for fault tolerance.
- **Min In-Sync Replicas:** Set `min.insync.replicas` to avoid data loss.
- **Delivery Guarantees:** Choose between at-most-once, at-least-once, or exactly-once semantics.

---

## Transactions & Outbox Pattern

- **Transactions:** Use Kafka transactions for atomic writes across topics.
- **Outbox Pattern:** Store events in a database outbox table and publish to Kafka for reliable integration.

- [Transactions quick config](../cheatsheets/best-practices.md#transactions-producer)

---

## Security & ACLs

- **Authentication:** Enable SASL for client authentication.
- **Encryption:** Use SSL/TLS for data encryption in transit.
- **Authorization:** Set up ACLs to control access to topics and resources.

- [Security quick config](../cheatsheets/best-practices.md#security-cli--configs)

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

- **Metrics:** Monitor broker, producer, and consumer metrics.
- **Logging:** Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for lag, disk usage, and broker failures.

- [Monitoring quick tips](../cheatsheets/best-practices.md#monitoring--alerting)

---

## Anti-patterns

- Using too few partitions, limiting scalability.
- Storing large messages in Kafka.
- Ignoring security and access controls.
- Not monitoring cluster health.
- Hardcoding configuration values.
